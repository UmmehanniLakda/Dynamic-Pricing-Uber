# Dynamic-Pricing-Uber
Developed a Machine Learning Model which is used to predict Uber Prices. <br/>
The user enters the Source, Destination, Time, Date and No. of Passengers based on which the output is predicted. <br/>
I have compared two algorithms here based on their accuracy so we come to know which algorithm predicts the best price amongst the two based on the above parameters.
